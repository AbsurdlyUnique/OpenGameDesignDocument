    | to pre-render the initial visits made to your application's pages.

    | You can specify a custom SSR bundle path, or omit it to let Inertia
    | try and automatically detect it for you.
    |
    | Do note that enabling these options will NOT automatically make SSR work,
    | as a separate rendering service needs to be available. To learn more,
